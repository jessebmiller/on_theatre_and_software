# On Theatre and Software

Theatre is the best example I know of highly creative cross functional teams creating a product, in this case a theatrical production, on time. The production is always on time with no exceptions that I have ever seen. Factors that make this possible include producers (the business people) staying the fuck out, flexibility in quality on opening night, a separation between designer (director, set designer, costume designer, etc.) and implementor (actor, carpenter, stitcher, draper) and the ability to estimate the amount of work involved in a given implementation. 

If a set designer is going to build the set they are designing, they are going to tend to design a set that is easy to build rather than the set that fit's the concept of the production. Plywood comes in 4' x 8' sheets so a set built by the designer will tend to have 8 foot high walls.

For software products, I think there is a gap to be bridged between a product manager who, like a director, is working on the level of the entire product and the developers who, like a carpenter, is working at the level of feature implementation. I think this is the place for UX designers, and software architects who work together iteratively as development progresses.

Designers and implementers are however tied in some ways. I don't think it's helpful to put someone without implementation experience in the designer role. Set designers have experience with carpentry, and therefor have some understanding of how much complexity they can put into their designs given the date of opening night and the size/experience of the set shop.

In an agile team with a sprint schedule, I envision a meeting of the product manager and the designers to discuss the progress to date and make product decisions for the near term as well as updating expectations and possibly goals about what product will be ready on whatever release date they may be aiming for (if any).
