# On Theatre and Software


## Forward
The organization of human production in an efficient, organized, and collaborative manner has been one of the cornerstones of humanities cultural and technological revolution through much of our history. One of the oldest crafts highly dependent upon a flawlessly well coordinated production with an on time, on budget, and high quality output, is that of theatrical production. Consequently, its methods have existed long before that of the industrial revolution, going at least as far back as that of the Greeks and Romans, both known for their contributions to theater, not just in writing, but in performance.

While the modern age of theater deploys a number of new technologies (rigging, electrical lighting, sound, etc.) the core mechanics at play have not changed much at all. This is due to the understanding of responsibilities. 

There is a saying in the theater: "Directors direct, and Actors act." This delineation of responsibilities is vital as it ensures the balance of power between the two opposing forces of a production (of any kind). This also requires a firm mutual respect and understanding of the rolls, as neither is more important or higher-up than the other. The best Directors in the world still need great actors to support their theatrical vision (and make their producers happy), just as the Actors rely on the Director to organize, construct, and drive the production to completion.



## Why The Theater
Theatre is the best example I know of highly creative cross functional teams creating a product, in this case a theatrical production, on time. The production is always on time with no exceptions that I have ever seen. Factors that make this possible include producers (the business people) staying the fuck out, flexibility in quality on opening night, a separation between designer (director, set designer, costume designer, etc.) and implementor (actor, carpenter, stitcher, draper) and the ability to estimate the amount of work involved in a given implementation. 

If a set designer is going to build the set they are designing, they are going to tend to design a set that is easy to build rather than the set that fit's the concept of the production. Plywood comes in 4' x 8' sheets so a set built by the designer will tend to have 8 foot high walls.

For software products, I think there is a gap to be bridged between a product manager who, like a director, is working on the level of the entire product and the developers who, like a carpenter, is working at the level of feature implementation. I think this is the place for UX designers, and software architects who work together iteratively as development progresses.

Designers and implementers are however tied in some ways. I don't think it's helpful to put someone without implementation experience in the designer role. Set designers have experience with carpentry, and therefor have some understanding of how much complexity they can put into their designs given the date of opening night and the size/experience of the set shop.

In an agile team with a sprint schedule, I envision a meeting of the product manager and the designers to discuss the progress to date and make product decisions for the near term as well as updating expectations and possibly goals about what product will be ready on whatever release date they may be aiming for (if any).
