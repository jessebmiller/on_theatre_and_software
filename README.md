Theatre is the best example I know of highly creative cross functional teams creating product, in this case a theatrical production, on time. The production is always on time, no exceptions that I have ever seen. Factors that make this possible include producers (the business people) staying the fuck out, flexibility in quality on opening night, a separation between designer (director, set designer, costume designer ...) and implementor (actor, carpenter, stitcher, draper) and the ability to estimate the amount of work involved in a given implementation.
